Introduction

Hello! We are Scube Labs and this is Nestmatics' Back end documentation. In here, information
about the back end methods, functions and overall module structure will be explained and presented.
This Documentation covers the back end functionalities of the Nestmatics applications, which
include the API, Handler, Machine Learning and DAO modules/packages. Additionally, in the Database
Format tab, you will find information about the format of entries in the database, to facilitate
